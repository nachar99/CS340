## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I just keep things simple. use simple names, clear comments, and break code up to diferrent parts. The CRUD module was perfect for that no repeating the same DB logic. I can use it again for any other Mongo project later.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I always break it down step by step. For this one, I looked at what the client wanted, did the DB first, then built each dashboard piece and tested as I went. I’d do the same in the future keep it clear and reuse what works.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
We make tools that help people do things better. This project helps Grazioso Salvare save time and find the right rescue dogs fast that’s a big deal for them.
